MMMLib  04/29/2014
======

MMMLib is a simple PHP library that allows the user to calculate the mean, median, or mode of an array of numbers. 


Usage
=================================================================================
Usage of the MMMLib is fairly simplistic, just create a new MMMCalc object in your script and call the functions passing in an array.

I have included a test.php file with an example of it's usage.
